This is my personal portfolio project. Everything should work just as it appears. 

There are 2 css folders in my github and I'm not sure why by my native files only come from 1 css folder. The php file is in there for the form on the contact page to actually work. As of right now it is inactive. I am not sure if this will work by the time you see my project past deadline.
